Controller_AI:
	Controller_AI holds all of the logic for controlling the AI's. The FSMs for their personalities are inside of their respective scripts, but this one is important
	for controlling their movements, rotations and senses. This does something too.

Agressive : 
	Agressive AI is a standard seek and destroy AI
	Patrol:
		Walks through his square hunting for the player. When he finds the player he goes into chase
	Chase:
		He runs directly at the player until he is within a range that a designer can specify and then keeps shooting until he loses the target or his health gets below half then he goes to flee.
	Flee:
		Runs away from the player to try to escape with his life. When enough time has passed he will return to try finish the job!

Guard : 
	Guard AI stays in his zone and tries to protect what is his!
	Patrol: 
		Walks around the room hunting for intuders. When he finds the player he goes into chase
	Chase:
		He will stand his ground until the threat is neutralized or leaves his sense range then he will return to patrol
		If he gets below half he will run away before returning to patrol
	Flee:
		Runs away from the player to try to gain some distance before re-engaging to get you off his lawn

Stalker : 
	Creepy AI that seems to run around randomly, but if he catches you from behind he will be relentless!
	Patrol: 
		Walks around the room hunting for intruders. When he finds the player he will go into chase.
	Chase: 
		He will try to get behind the player (distance up to designers) and then rotate to start firing at them.
		If he gets hit by the player he will run away. Stalkers don't like getting caught! 
		If he loses the player he will return to Patrol.
	Flee:
		Runs away for X time. Then he will return to Patrol state.

Skittish : 
	My personal favorite AI. He is a scared little tank who runs at the first sign of danger, but his curious nature always makes him check it out once he has calmed down!
	Patrol:
		He stays in place scanning his surroundings until he sees danger then runs away (Flee state)
	Chase:
		Returns to the place he heard the noise. If he finds an enemy there he will take aim and shoot at him before running away again.
		If he finds nothing there he will use that as his new hiding spot while he scans the area in patrol mode.
	Flee:
		He will run away for X seconds after recording the place he saw or heard the thing that scared him, so he can check it out later (during chase)
